# Note

Simple note-taking tool with tag support.

## About

A simple bash script for taking and tagging simple text notes. The notes and tags are stored as plain text files so they can be used in combination with a version control system (e.g. git). At the moment the name of the note is autogenerated so you don't have to think of a fitting name for a fast note. The possibility to name notes will probably be added sometime in the future because it would make it easier to work on a specific note over a long period of time. Other ideas for future development are adding support for folders and binary files.


## Installation

Simply clone the git repository in a convenient directory on your system:

    $ cd ~/Applications
    $ git clone git://github.com/fasta/note.git

Now create the directory where your notes should be located and edit the config file accordingly:

    $ cd ~/Documents
    $ mkdir Notes
    $ echo "REPO=~/Documents/Notes" > ~/Applications/note/config

Add an alias to your bash profile for easier access to the script:

    $ echo "alias 'n'='~/Applications/note/note.sh'" >> ~/.profile
